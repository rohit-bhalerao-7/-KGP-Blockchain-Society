# Fund-Me Contract Tasks
This repository contains the completed tasks for the Fund-Me contract. The following modifications and enhancements have been made to improve the contract's functionality and streamline its implementation:

## Task A: Ensure Unique Addresses in the Funders Array
The Funders array has been modified to ensure that it only contains unique addresses. This enhancement prevents the inclusion of duplicate addresses in the array, ensuring that the contract maintains an accurate record of individual funders. By ensuring unique addresses, the integrity and reliability of the Fund-Me contract are enhanced.

## Task B: Transfer Ownership Functionality
A new function has been implemented to enable the transfer of ownership to another address. This functionality allows the contract deployer to delegate ownership rights to a different address, facilitating smooth contract management and enabling the delegation of responsibilities. With this enhancement, the Fund-Me contract becomes more versatile and adaptable to changing ownership dynamics.

## Task C: Removal of Chain-Link Integration
The Chain-Link integration has been removed from the Fund-Me contract to simplify its implementation. While Chain-Link provides powerful external data integration capabilities, the decision to remove it was made to streamline the contract's complexity. By focusing primarily on handling funders' contributions and maintaining ownership functionality, the contract's implementation becomes more straightforward and easier to understand.

Your feedback and suggestions are welcome. Thank you for considering these completed tasks for the Fund-Me contract.
